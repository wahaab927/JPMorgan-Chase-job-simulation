🔍 Project Overview

This project is part of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Analytics Virtual Experience.
The objective of this task is to analyze, model, and interpret Natural Gas price movements using historical data and quantitative techniques—replicating the type of real-world analytical work performed by Quantitative Researchers at JPMorgan.

The project emphasizes:

Data-driven reasoning

Time-series behavior

Market-oriented insights


with a strong focus on clarity, accuracy, and practical financial interpretation, rather than black-box modeling.

🎯 Business Context

Natural Gas is a highly volatile commodity, influenced by multiple real-world factors such as:

❄️ Seasonal demand (winter heating & summer cooling)

🛢️ Storage levels and inventory cycles

⚠️ Supply disruptions

📊 Long-term market expectations


At JPMorgan, Quantitative Research teams analyze such instruments to:

Price financial contracts

Forecast future price movements

Support trading and risk management decisions


This task simulates how a Quantitative Research Analyst would:

Explore historical price data

Identify patterns

Justify assumptions using quantitative logic



---

🧠 Key Objectives

Understand historical Natural Gas price behavior

Identify trends, seasonality, and volatility patterns

Apply statistical and quantitative reasoning

Communicate insights clearly and professionally

Build a foundation for pricing and forecasting decisions



---

🔬 Methodology

1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing

Imported historical Natural Gas price data

Handled missing values and ensured date consistency

Converted data into time-series format for analysis


2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized price movements over time

Observed volatility patterns and long-term trends

Identified seasonal fluctuations


3️⃣ Trend & Pattern Identification

Analyzed upward and downward price movements

Studied cyclical behavior related to market demand

Examined stability vs volatility across periods


4️⃣ Quantitative Analytics Interpretation
